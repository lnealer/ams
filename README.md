# AMS Internal Asset Management

A legacy-style Java EE / Spring / Struts 2 hybrid web application, packaged as a WAR (and an EAR)
for WebSphere Liberty. Not a Spring Boot application: there is no embedded server and no fat jar,
and the entire bootstrap is driven by `web.xml`.

Every dependency version, where it is declared, and what blocks each upgrade: [TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md).

## Layout

Three Maven reactors, built in this order:

| Reactor | Modules |
|---|---|
| `ams-parent-bom` | Parent POM and dependency BOM (`pom` packaging) |
| `ams-common` | `AssetManagementSharedCommon`, `AssetManagementNetworkValidation`, `AssetManagementSharedServices` |
| `ams-internal` | `AssetManagementInternalCommon`, `AssetManagementInternalServices`, `AssetManagementInternalWeb` (war), `AssetManagementInternalEar` (ear) |

## Building

```bash
./build.sh
```

Builds and installs all three reactors in dependency order. `./build.sh package` or
`./build.sh test` work too.

Requires JDK 17 with `JAVA_HOME` pointed at it (the script defaults to a Zulu 17 install) and
Maven 3.9. The compiler targets Java 8 bytecode throughout.

## Architecture

**Two web frameworks side by side.** Struts 2 handles every functional endpoint through
`StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter`, mapped to `/*`. Spring MVC's `DispatcherServlet` is mounted only
at `/ams/*` and hosts exactly one `@Controller`, for the two global error pages. There are no
`@RestController` classes. `struts.action.excludePattern` keeps the Struts filter off the Spring
MVC path.

**No ORM.** Persistence is Spring JDBC throughout: `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`, hand-written
Oracle SQL held as string constants, and manual `RowMapper` implementations. Transactions are
managed by `DataSourceTransactionManager`. There is no JPA, no Hibernate, no `.hbm.xml` and no
`@Entity` anywhere, and the build asserts none of them are on the classpath.

**No Lombok.** Every domain object has hand-written accessors, `implements Serializable` and an
explicit `serialVersionUID`.

**Pre-authenticated SSO.** There is no login form. A reverse proxy authenticates the caller and
forwards `iv-user` / `iv-groups` headers; `WebSealRequestHeaderAuthenticationFilter` reads them and
`AmsUserDetailsService` resolves the directory groups into roles through a database mapping table.
Authorisation is one role per action — about fifty `SecurityRoleType` constants — checked per
action method rather than by URL pattern.

**Legacy typesafe enums.** `LoadableType` is an abstract base carrying a code, a description and a
database surrogate key; subclasses expose `public static final` singletons registered in a
`LinkedHashMap` so `values()` keeps declaration order for drop-downs.

## The database

Oracle. The schema lives in `db/oracle/` and is built by `00_init.sh`, which the container runs on
first boot:

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `01_tables/` | 35 tables — 32 translated from the H2 fixtures, plus three the PL/SQL and the ordering flow need |
| `02_constraints/` | 69 check constraints, 32 foreign keys |
| `03_indexes/` | 82 indexes |
| `04_sequences/` | 18 sequences |
| `05_views/` | `AMS_NCR_SCHEDULES_EXT_V` |
| `06_packages/` | 3 package specs and 3 bodies — the 9 stored procedures the Java calls |
| `07_seed/` | reference data, calendars and demo rows, in foreign-key order |
| `09_validate/` | the acceptance gate |

The table DDL is **generated from the H2 fixtures**, not hand-copied, so column names and types
cannot drift from the schema the DAO tests run against.

Two tables exist only here, because the procedures cannot be written correctly without them:
`AMS_TIMESLOT_RESERVATIONS` (a ledger behind `AMS_TIMESLOTS.RESERVED_COUNT`, without which
`cancel_timeslot` would decrement blind and a double-cancel would eventually double-book a slot)
and `AMS_CIRCUIT_WINDOWS` (what `p_circuit_window_id` and `p_released_count` refer to).

**No procedure commits.** The callers are inside a Spring `@Transactional` sharing the same
connection, so a `COMMIT` in PL/SQL would silently commit the caller's work and destroy its
rollback. Each takes a `SAVEPOINT` instead, so a status other than `OK` reliably means nothing was
changed.

`09_validate/validate.sql` is the acceptance gate and fails the container if the schema is wrong.
It asserts object counts, that nothing is `INVALID`, and then **smoke-calls every one of the nine
procedures**. That last part is not optional: Spring's `StoredProcedure` binds positionally and
`compile()` never reads database metadata, so a signature mismatch is invisible until a user
clicks the button. Nothing else in the build checks it.

## Running the whole stack

```bash
./build.sh docker
```

Builds the three reactors, then `docker compose up --build`: Oracle 23ai Free plus the Liberty
application wired to it. The app waits for the database to report healthy. First boot builds the
schema and runs the gate — watch it with `docker compose logs -f oracle`.

`docker compose up -d oracle` brings up just the database if you only want somewhere to point at.

## Deploying

The image is built from `AssetManagementInternalWeb/Dockerfile` on
`websphere-liberty:26.0.0.8-full-java8-ibmjava`, listening on 9081 (HTTP) and 9444 (HTTPS,
TLSv1.2). Liberty configuration is in `src/main/liberty/config`.

Two files are **not** in this repository and must be supplied before the image will build — each
directory has a README explaining what belongs there:

- `AssetManagementInternalWeb/lib/ojdbc8-23.8.0.25.04.jar` — the runtime Oracle driver, matching
  the 23ai server. Not redistributable, which is why the build resolves 12.2.0.1 from Maven
  Central for tests only; the two never have to agree.
- `AssetManagementInternalWeb/certs/internal-ca.crt` — the internal CA the proxy and the platform
  REST services are signed by. For local use, any self-signed certificate will do.

Database connection details and the keystore password come from the environment through
`bootstrap.properties`. No credential is committed; `docker-compose.yml` carries development
defaults for a throwaway local database only.

The Spring profile selects the security wiring: `production` and `qa` register the real
header-reading filter, while `local`, `dev` and `fit` register a developer stub that asserts a
fixed identity when no proxy is in front of the container. Set it in `jvm.options`.

## Testing

239 tests across the five code modules.

DAO and service integration tests run against an embedded H2 database created by the DDL scripts
under `src/test/resources/sql` — one file per table, plus sequences, a view and seed data, wired up
by `test-context-h2.xml`. The internal module reuses the shared module's scripts through its
test-jar rather than keeping a second copy that could drift.

Every statement the DAOs issue is written in the subset both Oracle and H2 accept, so the SQL that
runs in the tests is the SQL that runs in production.

The web module's tests stand the real Spring Security filter chain up and drive requests through
it, and walk the Struts configuration asserting that every action class, every action method and
every result JSP actually exists.

## Deviations from the specification

Seven, all deliberate:

1. **Packaging plugin versions.** `maven-war-plugin` 2.6 and `maven-ear-plugin` 2.8 cannot load
   under Maven 3.9 — they fail with a Plexus API incompatibility before the build starts. Bumped
   to 3.4.0 and 3.3.0; the original values are recorded in a comment in the parent POM. Every other
   pinned version is exactly as specified.

2. **Base image.** The specified `websphere-liberty:26.0.0.2-full-java8-openj9-ubi-minimal` does
   not exist, and neither does any java8 + openj9 combination — IBM publishes Java 8 Liberty on
   IBM Java only, with OpenJ9 variants starting at Java 11. Using
   `26.0.0.8-full-java8-ibmjava` instead: same Liberty feature set, same Java 8. Java 8 was kept
   rather than moving to a Java 17 image because the whole build targets it
   (`maven.compiler.target`, the `jdbc-4.1` feature, `ojdbc8`). The cost is that no Java 8 Liberty
   image is built for arm64, so on Apple Silicon that one container runs emulated — see the
   `platform` pin in `docker-compose.yml`, which should be removed on an amd64 host.

3. **Runtime JDBC driver.** `ojdbc8-23.8.0.25.04` rather than the specified 21.5.0.0, matching the
   Oracle 23ai server the compose stack runs. The BOM's test-scope pin stays at 12.2.0.1 as
   specified; the two are independent.

4. **Authenticated principal types.** `AmsUser`, `AmsRole` and `WebSealPrincipal` live in
   `AssetManagementInternalCommon` rather than in the web module's `web.security` package. The
   services module resolves roles and has to return an `AmsUser`, and it cannot depend on the WAR.
   The filters, provider and CSRF matcher are in `web.security` as specified.

5. **Search grid markup.** The specification describes the search action building inline HTML
   anchors into its grid rows. The action returns a flat `AssetGridRow` of plain values instead and
   the JSP builds the links from the identifiers, so an asset tag or serial containing markup is
   escaped rather than rendered. Sending markup from the action would make every asset field a
   stored XSS vector.

6. **Legacy outer-join syntax.** Oracle's `(+)` syntax appears once, in `AmsServicesDAOImpl`, and
   is marked Oracle-only. Everything else uses ANSI joins so the SQL can be exercised against H2.

7. **Dojo Toolkit.** `js/dojo-release-1.17.3/` is present but empty, with a README explaining what
   belongs there. The toolkit is a third-party distribution of several thousand files.
   `js/common.js` is written against the DOM directly and does not depend on it.

## Ordering an asset

The ordering flow collects everything needed to stage a device and get it to site, in six steps.
Each validates its own input; the partly completed order lives in the session, so nothing is
written until it is placed and an abandoned order leaves no rows behind.

| Step | Screen | What it collects |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | New order | Order type, and for a replacement the asset it replaces |
| 1 | Contact information | Ordering, shipping and installation contacts |
| 2 | Address | Shipping and installation address, checked against the address validation service |
| 3 | Device details | Device nickname and the weekly maintenance window |
| 4 | External configuration | WAN and LAN addressing, run through the WAN and LAN validators |
| 5 | Subscriber PCs | The machines that will sit behind the device |
| 6 | Despatch window | The shipping window, then **Place order** |

There is **no review step**. Every step validates as it is left and the place step re-validates the
whole model, so a review page would only repeat what the user had just been through. The
confirmation page is the receipt: it is the one place the whole order is shown together.

Three things are worth knowing about how this behaves:

- **The despatch window is not held while it is being looked at.** It is reserved through
  `AMS_SCHEDULING_PG.reserve_timeslot` at the moment the order is placed. If it fills in between,
  the order is still placed — there is no review step to go back to, and discarding six screens of
  keyed data over a warehouse slot would be the wrong trade — but `SHIP_WINDOW_ID` is left null so
  nothing claims capacity the reservation ledger does not back, and the confirmation says so.
- **A postcode with no warehouse region yields no windows.** That is a gap in
  `AMS_INSTALL_REGIONS`, not an error: the order can still be placed and operations assign a window
  by hand.
- **Address validation never blocks an order.** A correction is offered for the user to accept or
  refuse, and an outage lets the address through marked unverified.

Despatch windows are carried on `AMS_TIMESLOTS` with `CALL_TYPE_CD = 'SHIP'` rather than in a table
of their own: a window is warehouse capacity per region per day, which is exactly what that table
already models, so booking one goes through the same reservation procedure and the same ledger as
everything else.

## Two schemas to keep in step

The H2 fixtures under `src/test/resources/sql` and the Oracle DDL under `db/oracle` describe the
same tables and both have to be changed together. The Oracle table DDL is generated from the H2
files by a translator for exactly that reason, but the seed data and the two Oracle-only tables
are not — when a column changes, check both.

## Demonstration data

The original seed (`07_seed/17` to `32`) is deliberately sparse: every row in it is load-bearing
for some DAO test, so it is not safe to add to and not much to look at. Two later files exist for
driving the portal instead.

`07_seed/38_AMS_DEMO_LIFECYCLE.sql` adds four customers, each parked at a different point in the
lifecycle so that every screen has something real on it:

| Customer | Region | State |
|---|---|---|
| Northwind Coffee Roasters | WEST | live and healthy — order completed, asset active, install done |
| Beacon Hill Physio | NORTHEAST | order in flight — despatch window held, installation not yet booked |
| Lakeshore Legal Partners | CENTRAL | steady state — two assets, config revisions, open and closed change requests |
| Sundial Grocery Co-op | WEST | end of life — decommission scheduled, RMA issued, replacement ordered |

Nothing there is referenced by a test, so it can be changed freely. Ids sit in the range 1010–9199,
above the original seed and below 100000 where the sequences start, so nothing the running
application creates can collide with it.

Two details are worth knowing:

- **It is re-runnable.** Everything in those id ranges is deleted first, in reverse foreign-key
  order. Calendar places are given back through `AMS_SCHEDULING_PG.cancel_timeslot` rather than by
  deleting the ledger rows, because deleting them directly would leave `RESERVED_COUNT` overstated
  and slowly close the calendar for everyone. Re-running leaves the total reserved count unchanged.
- **The despatch windows are booked through the real procedure**, not by writing the ledger row and
  bumping the counter by hand. The counter and the ledger therefore agree by construction, and the
  seed exercises the same code path the ordering flow uses — so a signature change breaks the
  container build rather than surfacing on someone's screen.

`07_seed/37_AMS_FACILITATION_WINDOWS.sql` generates rolling installation and tech-line capacity.
This one fixes a dead end rather than adding decoration: `07_seed/14` seeds four slots on fixed
September 2025 dates, which is right for the DAO tests but means that from the day after seeding
both calendars are empty and an order can be placed but never scheduled. The gate now asserts that
future bookable installation and tech-line windows exist, for the same reason it already asserted
it for despatch windows.

To load both against a database that is already running:

```bash
docker compose exec -T oracle sqlplus -S ams/ams_app_pw@//localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 \
  @/opt/ams/sql/07_seed/37_AMS_FACILITATION_WINDOWS.sql
```

On a fresh volume `00_init.sh` runs them in filename order along with everything else, but only
when `AMS_CUSTOMERS` is empty.

### Refreshing the calendars

The despatch, installation and tech-line windows are generated relative to `SYSDATE`, and the seed
only runs on an empty database — so on a volume that has been up for a few weeks they age into the
past and the calendars quietly empty out. Roll them forward with:

```bash
for f in 36_AMS_SHIPPING_WINDOWS 37_AMS_FACILITATION_WINDOWS; do
  printf 'SET DEFINE OFF\n@/opt/ams/sql/07_seed/%s.sql\nCOMMIT;\nEXIT\n' "$f" \
    | docker compose exec -T oracle sqlplus -S ams/ams_app_pw@//localhost:1521/FREEPDB1
done
```

Both files clear only future slots that nobody holds, so a window an order is relying on is never
taken away. Aged-out windows in the past are normal and are not an error — `validate.sql` reports
how many have aged out but only fails when there are no bookable future ones left.

## Verification status

Confirmed against a running stack, not just by test:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `./build.sh` — all three reactors | 284 tests, 0 failures |
| Oracle schema built by the container | 35 tables, 18 sequences, 1 view |
| Schema built once, as `AMS` in `FREEPDB1` | no second pass as `SYS` in the CDB root |
| Ordering flow, all six steps, end to end | order placed; every association persisted |
| Address validation — correction offered | suggestion page shown, accepted, stored `VALIDATED_FL = 'Y'` |
| Address validation — service unavailable | "not verified" page; order still placeable |
| Despatch window reservation | `AMS_TIMESLOT_RESERVATIONS` row `HELD`, `RESERVED_COUNT` incremented |
| PL/SQL objects | 3 packages + 3 bodies, **0 invalid**, 0 compilation errors |
| All 9 procedures smoke-called | every one returns its expected status |
| Demo data, four customers | every screen renders their rows; both open orders hold a real despatch window |
| Demo seed re-run | no duplicates, total `RESERVED_COUNT` unchanged |
| Installation calendar | 54 bookable slots returned per customer — was 0 before `07_seed/37` |
| Switching customer mid-order | in-progress order discarded; the next order is attributed to the customer on screen |
| `/health` and `/health.action` unauthenticated | `200 OK`, body `OK` |
| Production profile, no proxy headers | `403` on every other path, no login redirect |
| Production profile, `iv-user: Unauthenticated` | `403` — the proxy's "not signed in" literal is not an identity |
| Production profile, real headers | request served |
| Application → Oracle | a live search returns seeded rows; JDBC driver reports 23.8.0.25.04 |

The end-to-end ordering check is a scripted walk through all six screens against the running
container. It places a real order and then reads the row back: the three contacts, the shipping
address, the maintenance window, the configuration, both subscriber PCs, the despatch window and
its ledger entry, and the queued confirmation email are all confirmed in the database rather than
inferred from the confirmation page.

The procedure smoke test covers the cases mocks cannot: reserving a full slot returns
`NO_CAPACITY`, reserving twice does not double-count, cancelling twice returns `NOT_RESERVED` and
leaves the counter intact, a decommission beyond the 42-day window is refused, and a repeated
notification is suppressed rather than queued again.

### Known wart

Liberty writes an FFDC incident for `DSRA9010E: 'setReadOnly' is not supported` on every
`@Transactional(readOnly = true)` entry. Spring catches it and logs at debug — the request
succeeds — but the incident files accumulate. Fixing it properly means switching the datasource
`res-sharing-scope` to `Unshareable`, which changes connection-pool behaviour, so it is left
alone deliberately rather than traded for a worse problem.
