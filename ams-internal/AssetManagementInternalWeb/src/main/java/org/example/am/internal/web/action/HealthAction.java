 * runs every few seconds and there is no reason to spin up the view layer for it. It reads nothing
 * and touches no database, so it stays cheap and cannot fail for a reason unrelated to the
 * application being up.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is the one endpoint permitted without authentication. It is safe to expose because it
 * neither reads nor writes anything: the response is a fixed string.</p>
